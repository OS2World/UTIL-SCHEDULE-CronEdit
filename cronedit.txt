cronedit.exe ... editor for cron-files

cronedit.exe was written in order to learn about visually programming REXX (yes,
it *is* written with REXX only) with the IBM-EWS-tool DrDialog resp. DrREXX,
which was put on IBM's DevCon 6.

It allows for visually editing cron-files, so "amateurs" and "lazy" people
should be able to take advantage of cronrgf (or the like) immediately.

cronedit.exe was written, such that it checks whether the cron-files contain a
CR-LF (carriage return/linefeed as used in DOS or OS/2 files) or LF (linefeeds
only, as used in Unix files) at the end of lines, in order to preserve them.

Enjoy.

P.S.: The source will be found in cronedit.RES and may be looked at with
DrDialog from DevCon.
